面试官你好，我叫陈宜，我是去年毕业于  ，  我的上一家公司主要是业务是做医院里系统设计的，我于去年四月份在这家公司进行实习，后来转正。我在公司里的职位是Java开发，使用过SSM框架，SpringBoot等等框架。还使用过mysql，oracle数据库，非关系型数据库redis。

在公司的一年里，接触了几个大大小小的项目，华山医院体检中心管理系统，华山医院投诉管理系统，华山北院医技预约系统，我就挑其中一个重要的项目来进行阐述。

华山北院医技预约系统这个项目是公司去年年底接手的一个全新的项目。主要功能就是帮助病人预约检查。我在这个项目中的主要职责就是负责前后端的开发，由于是一家小型公司，而项目本身又比较的小，所以我一个人包揽了整个。整个的业务流程为：病人拿着他的就诊卡来到指定的窗口，然后工作人员会拿着他的卡进行刷卡，然后和HIS系统那边获取到他的基本数据信息，然后获取到预约的基本信息，然后点击预约按钮就可以跳转并获得可预约日期，确定日期之后，将跳转获取可预约时间点以及检查点。确认预约完毕后，将会打印告知单以及发送短信通知给病人。这个项目后端采用Springboot框架以及mybatis等orm框架。前端采用了Vue框架，并搭载了ElementUI组件。整体项目开发周期维持了四五个月，完成预约模块功能，在项目中遇到的主要的难题为，如何合理的展示日期，如果仅仅是从后端生成并存放至数组中似乎显得不是那么的合适，于是便为此特地创建了一张静态资源表，专门用来存放相关的时间日期即可，然后跑动相应的定时任务即可。由于面试的是后端岗位，所以前端也就不进行更详细的阐述了。

至于我为什么选择离开这家公司，原因也很简单，由于项目都属于传统项目，然后又是医院里面的B端产品，所以本身对技术上的要求也没有很高，因此想要寻求一份要求更高，然后规模更大的单位，以此来增长自己的技术。





Hello, interviewer, my name is Chen Yi, I graduated from  last year, my last company is mainly engaged in hospital system design, I had an internship in this company in April last year, and then became a full-time employee. My position in the company is Java development, and I have used SSM framework, SpringBoot and other frameworks. Also used MySQL, Oracle database, non-relational database  like Redis. I have been working for one year. 

During my one year in the company, I got in touch with several large and small projects, such as the physical examination center management system of Huashan Hospital, the complaint management system of Huashan Hospital, and the medical technology appointment system of Huashan North Hospital. I will choose one of the important projects to explain.

The medical technology reservation system of Huashan North Hospital is a brand new project that the company took over at the end of last year. Its main function is to help patients make appointments. My main responsibility in this project was to take charge of the development of the front and back ends. As it was a small company and the project itself was relatively small, I undertook the whole project by myself. The whole business process is as follows: Patients took HIS clinic card came to the specified window, then the staff will take HIS card for card, and then HIS system to HIS basic data information over there, and then to make an appointment for basic information, then click the reservation button to jump and get the booking date, after the determine the date, will jump to get booking time points and checkpoints. Once the appointment is confirmed, the notification form will be printed and a text message will be sent to the patient. The backend of this project adopts SpringBoot framework and ORM framework such as MyBatis. The front end uses the VUE framework and carries the elementUI component. The overall project development cycle lasted for four or five months, complete the booking module function, the main problem encountered in the project, how to reasonable display date, if only from the back-end to generate and store to array seems not so right, so for this specially created a static resource list, specially used to store related time date only can, Then run the corresponding timed task. Since the interview is for a back-end position, the front-end will not elaborate in more detail.


 As for why I choose to leave this company, the reason is very simple. Since the projects are all traditional projects and B-end products in the hospital, I do not have high technical requirements. Therefore, I want to find a larger unit with higher requirements so as to improve my technology.
